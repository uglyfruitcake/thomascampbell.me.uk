One way of grouping strategies is be splitting them into “nice” and “mean”
strategies. Nice strategies will never defect before their opponent has defected
and so will never defect first. Hence if two nice strategies play each other,
the outcome will always be cooperation on every turn. This is called a
“cooperation cycle”.

A mean strategy is a strategy that may defect before the opponent. Any
randomised strategy is by definition mean.

The advantage of a nice strategy is that when both players cooperate they
maximise their points as a pair. They receive 6 points overall, which is more
than any other situation.

Mean strategies will anger other strategies by defecting. If two strategies end
up defecting against each other on every turn it is called a “defection cycle”.
This is the worst possible outcome as the pair only receives 2 points overall.

Therefore it is easy to see that a cooperation cycle is desirable.

In his original tournaments Axelrod concluded that nice strategies will normally
outperform mean strategies. This is because the winner of both tournaments was
"Tit for Tat" which was a nice strategy. Tit for Tat worked by cooperating on
the first round and then copying the opponents last decision. It was a very
simple strategy.
