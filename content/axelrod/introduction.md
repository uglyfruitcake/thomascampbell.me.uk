I recently started contributing to a project called Axelrod-Python and have
found it very interesting.

Axelrod-Python is a python project dedicated to recreating Robert Axelrodâ€™s
original iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments in the 1980's. The Github
repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod).

Axelrod's original tournament was used to simulate evolution and investigate how
cooperation can evolve over time. This project aims to reproduce that work. You
can read about Axelrod's original tournaments and learn more about the
prisoner's dilemma
[here](http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/background.html).

Axelrod-Python is an open source project and so anyone can contribute. If you
want to contribute, there are instructions on how to on the repository
[Readme](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod).
